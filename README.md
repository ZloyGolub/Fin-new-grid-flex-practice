Fin News - Responsive Layout Practice with Grid and Flexbox 2020 year

Welcome to Fin News, a practice project focused on mastering responsive web design using CSS Grid and Flexbox. This website layout was created as part of my journey to improve front-end development skills and learn how to build adaptive designs for various screen sizes.

Key features of this project include:

Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
Implementation of CSS Grid for complex layouts
Use of Flexbox for flexible and intuitive alignment
A mock financial news portal structure with headlines, sections, and navigation
While this site doesnâ€™t provide real news, it serves as a demonstration of responsive design principles and adaptive layout techniques. Feel free to explore and resize your browser to see the design in action!
